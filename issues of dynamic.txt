"What is the problem of using dynamic memory allocation?"

Image result for what are the issues of dynamic memory allocation in cpp
The problem with dynamic memory allocation is that it is not deallocated itself, 
developer responsibility to deallocate the allocated memory explicitly. 
If we cannot release the allocated memory, 
it can because of memory leak and make your machine slow.
